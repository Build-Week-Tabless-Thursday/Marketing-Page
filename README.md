## Documentation
This project utilizes HTML, LESS, CSS, and a teensy bit of JavaScript to pull member info from the github API (credit to Mr. Sedlacek on the last bit). Hosted on netlify: https://inspiring-stonebraker-d1e680.netlify.com/index.html

## Proposal

### What problem does your app solve?
Organization. Make a like a to-do list for tabs.

### Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
Allows you to store the url that you want to read.
Then add a description of what it is for.
This will reduce the amount open tabs needed.

This differs from bookmarking in:
Allows descriptions of tabs.
Syncs on the cloud and is not directly tied to the browser or platform.
Easier to delete or add tabs then the built in bookmarking systems in most browsers.
(Stretch) Allows you to specify which day the tab is for and bring up that tab on that specific day.

### What is the mission statement?
For the Tab-Hoarder in all of us

## Features
### What features are required for your minimum viable product?
Sign in.
Navigation on all pages.
CRUD operations for saving tabs.
Home Page
Category page

### What features do you wish to put in a future release?
Allow users to specify which day the tab is for and bring up that tab on that specific day.
Chrome Extension.
Sharing Categories.

### What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?
OneTab - (Chrome Extension) Provides basic tab list and allows sharing list via URLs.
Toby - (Chrome Extension) Provides a drag and drop interface for managing tabs into groups and organizing tabs in a meaningful way.
Evernote - Allows users to stay more organized by putting all their notes in one easy to access place. Also allows for clipping off the web.

## Design - Planning
### What design system will you use?
Material Design

### What will your user flow be?
Sign in / Create an Account ->
 -- Home Page with most Recent tabs -> 
 -- -- User taps on tab to open it
 -- -- User taps add to add a tab 
 -- -- User taps nav to see categories and user switcher ->
 -- -- --  User taps category to go to category page
 -- -- --  User taps user account to sign out or edit

### What is the URL to your wireframes?

## Target Audience

### Who is your target audience? Be specific.
Professional and Non-Professional users.
Those who don’t want to be locked into a single platform.
Anyone who has too many tabs and not enough space.

### What feedback have you gotten from potential users?
That they prefer bookmarks.

### Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?
They wouldn't use it.


## Research

### Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
